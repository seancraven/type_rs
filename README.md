# type_rs
Not to be confused with types this is a small command line typing app that I am working on as a side project. 
I got sick and tired of how slow monkeytype was. I also would prefer to type in sentences than random words. 
However quotes seem to general, I think that there is space to have a generative model end point for the typing.
# Plan
